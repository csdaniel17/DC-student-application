# DC Student Application

## Overview
* An online application portal for DigitalCrafts. Prospective students can register for an account, login, and save their progress throughout the application process. Should the student forget their password, they can request a temporary password which will be automatically emailed to them. After the student finishes and submits the application, DigitalCrafts will be sent an email containing the application information.
